<h2>A tool to share puzzles online</h2>

<h5>Puzzle applet</h4>

The solving applet at <code>https://puzz.link/p</code> stores user preferences in the
browser local storage. These preferences are not shared with the puzz.link servers.

Additionally, when logged in to an account at the puzzle database (see below), the
applet sends information about solved puzzles to the puzz.link servers.

<h5>Puzzle database</h4>

It's possible to create an account with the puzz.link database at
<code>https://puzz.link/db</code>. In that case, we store account details to
enable login. You can optionally provide an email address which will be used to
get in touch for important issues relating to your account, such as password reset.
<p>
When you log in to the puzz.link database, we store a session identifier in the
browser local storage.
<p>
When interacting with the puzz.link database while logged in, we store data such
as tags and solve status as entered while interacting with the database. Furthermore,
when you solve puzzles using the puzz.link applet while logged in, those solves
will be recorded in your account.
